[2022-05-10 21:37:01] local.ERROR: SQLSTATE[22001]: String data, right truncated: 1406 Data too long for column 'old_notes' at row 1 (SQL: insert into `file_reason` (`target_date`, `old_notes`, `new_notes`, `mistake_by`, `reason`, `order_id`, `order_master_id`, `order_child_id`, `last_status`, `user_id`, `user_name`, `designer`, `teamleader`, `updated_at`, `created_at`) values (2022/05/11 02:00, I have sent you this picture I need this picture remade. The picture below is the original picture I need to take this picture and edit it to what I need it to be done. I need this picture back to rise in size to be a postcard 4 x 6. I need to turn this into a postcard so it must be clean crisp and vectorize.

Here in this picture I have sent you the edits of what I need please let’s go through the details and read them carefully.

1. I need to remove all the words that are on the postcard the words meaning the ones that are at the bottom and the artist name who drew it. I have scratched those out in red. Everything that you see in red I need to take off the flyer completely. There can be no nudity going through the mail so everything you see in red I need it taking off also the 4 girls that are remaining I need to cover their breast they cannot have open breast showing. I have put black lines over them maybe that can be what we can do to cover it.

2. Where all the brown circles are I need to turn those white people into brown people or Black people the color of the people needs to be a little bit darker but not too dark like a brownish color so you can tell they are african American people.

3. The other two girls I want to make them another race as well they can be white girls. Or one can be white and one can have like a peach color to her. I will also put names over each girl I will send you those names. SHIRVELL B. AMY B. DEMI B. JANIA C.
The head lady here name above her will be LORRAINE.
Over the guys head I want to put “Your Husband/Boyfriend”

4. I also need to extend it a little bit so I can have time to add words can you start this stuff right here and then we go from there <br />Changes #notes:Here are the edits for the post card photo. 
1st thing I need the background extended on the top and bottom so we can add words and the picture needs to be a nice size in the middle.

The 2 people the brown people are too dark can you make them a little shade lighter. It’s hard to see there face or hair when it’s so dark.

The name I want them in a nice clear cursive font above each head woman’s head.
The first girl name needs to be Amy B. 
The 2nd name should be [YOU]
The 3rd name should be Demi B.
The 4th name should be Jania C.
 
The big woman’s name should be Lorraine B. Under it put “Big Mama Benjamins” 

The man’s name should be Your Husband/Boyfriend 

I Need to have room for text boxes. On top bottom and on the side where I circled in black. The red scribble lines are meant to show to add more room on the postcard for text words.<br /> <br />Changes #notes:Ok I think we are not reading what I’m writing and sending examples.
The names are in the wrong order. 
The writing is not in cursive like I asked for.
The guy is still too dark.<br /> <br />Changes #notes:OK this is still not right let me break it down a little bit more so we can get a better understanding can you please read this Word for Word so you can see where I’m coming from. 

First things first I need to spread out and make more room on the postcard meaning there needs to be room up top two right words in there needs to be room at the bottom to write words in and room on the side to write words in. They do not have to be boxes they just have to be room I have highlighted them and box them in yellow till you can see what I am talking about and where I want my words to go. There are four boxes on each side of this cart so I need four blank spaces one on top one on bottom and two on the sides I have also added one box in the middle if you can space apart the two groups of people a little bit so that way when I put the address there the address can go there.

The names are in the wrong position if you’re looking at the card the first person with yellow hair of the first white girl should be Demi B. Then “You” Then AMY B. Then Jania C. Please make the font a little bit bigger so people can read it 
Also with Lorraine’s name and the other guy make those fonts bigger place to as well.

For box one I want it to say this All in the same font that we currently have on there just big nice size letters so he can be read. These let you should be bigger than the other one.

“Precision Focused since 1983”

Also their p&f Machining logo. 

 
Changes #notes:I need the P&F Logo on the full back with the flag also.

Could you please send another layout besides this one?  I was thinking the tag line    "Precision Focused since 1983"  going across the lower part of the logo over the top of the flag, and then the p&f logo centered on top of the flag but not too small.

Hope you understand.   I would like to give them 2 options.

Also, please use a black background for the shirt.
 
Changes #notes:I requested to have a Black Background.

Also, on the p&f logo, please make the purple areas black.  Then I think we should be good to go
 
Changes #notes:Please see below my customers request;

Hey Deb I think it's a great start.   Can we have your graphic design person change that red caliper/micrometer to White and then put all the lettering in our logo red and see how that looks.
 
Changes #notes:No still not quite what I was looking for, lets try this using the first file you sent me.



Turn the caliper to a dark grey, just enough so it stands out from the white of the flag.

All the text in our logo lets make that a maroon, or better yet a similar color to what is actually used in our logo like in my signature below.

Any questions let me know.
 
Changes #notes:You forgot to put in the p&f logo over the flag.
 
Changes #notes:Deb I think we are getting really close.   The T-shirts will be black, so if they could switch the background back to black.   Also I liked the Precision Focused wording above the flag, I think it gets lost in there otherwise.  Lets also switch just the “precision focused since 1983“ text to white.
