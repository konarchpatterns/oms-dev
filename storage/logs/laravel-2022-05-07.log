Project: Martin County PAL Yard Signs

 

Request –

 

Qty 16 – double sided signs – various sizes based on wording (all signs need to be 11” wide because they will be on stakes and the stakes are 10” wide).

Background color are different shades of green for each sign.

Attached is a sign that has their green that you can use for shading.

 

**Looking for yard signs that are taller with words on them (Vertical) 

I want to put all 16 lessons on each sign see attached lesson sheet.  Units 1-4 so it would be 16 signs total front and back

I was wondering if we can make each sign a different shade of green?

 

16 Words Are:

Choices, Growth, Attitude, Commitment, Relationships, Character, Forgiveness, Self-Worth, Responsibility, Courage, Initiative, Priorities, Teachability, Self-Discipline, Resilience, and Influence

Changes #notes:Thank you for the files – the background color for each sign was supposed to be a different shade of green. Sign one is good but then sign 2 through 16 should be a shade lighter for each one. The wording orientation (vertical) is great but can we spread the letters out so that they look like the picture below instead of having all of that space at the top and bottom of the sign; and the height of each sign will be different based on the word. So each sign is to be 11” wide and the height will vary for each sign.
